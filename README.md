# susquash
a plugin that crushes shit massively.


it has 2 knobs:

squash >> how much it squashes shit.

gain >> how much quieter you want your squashed shit to be.


this plugin was inspired by a video by dan worrall in which he presented a
full beat, that he made, which only consists of 1s and -1s.
i felt like that's a really creative thing to do and there should be
a plugin that helps producers to squash there shit to death, sooo,
here it is :)
